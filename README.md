# DL-Arabic-OCR

    In this project we will create deep learning models and data augmentation techniques using different librairies like tensorflow and pytorch for arabic optical characther recognition.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.7

- anaconda-navigator 

#### Setup

    Create an annaconda environement and use this command to install all the neccesary librairies

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv jupyter tensorflow pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=/%Your CUDA version%/ -c pytorch
```

After this all you need to do is start coding using your code editor of your choice

#### Working methode

    For an easier collaboration and workflow we will work using the agile methodology SCRUM. The work will be divided in different sprint listed in a [Scrumboard](http://scrumblr.ca/Arabic-OCR). Regular meeting will be done to update the different sprints.

    For the report we will work on it gradualy on this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LfTTOCg9MX0VYm2_1R6gqAsWQKD_z8l9puS1_IiPHsI/edit)

    The slide will be done when at least 80% of the project will be done
