# DL-Arabic-OCR

    In this project we will create deep learning models and data augmentation techniques using different librairies like tensorflow and pytorch for arabic optical characther recognition.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.7

- anaconda-navigator 

#### Setup

    Create an annaconda environement and use this command to install all the neccesary librairies

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv jupyter flask tensorflow pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=/%Your CUDA version%/ -c pytorch
```

After this all you need to do is start coding using your code editor of your choice

#### Download the model

The model being too heavy to be push on github it has to be download from this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19hVNPWHn3c2S2YDq1sYrogn-SpIJb_ud/view?usp=sharing)
Once done all you need to do is to put the model on the tf-file folder
